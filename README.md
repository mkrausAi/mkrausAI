### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at ETH Zurich, at the departments of Civil, Environmental and Geomatics Engineering. I am working with Prof. Dr. Walter Kaufmann (Bridge Design and Concrete Structures) and other member of the Institute of Structural Analysis and Construction (IBK). I am leading part of the Design++ initiative and the new Immersive Design Lab at ETHZ.

I am interested in interdisciplinary research between Civil Engineering and Machine Perception. My area of focus is on automated semantic and operational understanding of buildings throughout their life cycle using visual data.

I studied civil engineering at Technical University Munich and completed my PhD at Bundeswehr University Munich in February 2019, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. My research was concerned with machine learning based material modelling of interlayer polymers and glass fracture patterns. From January to September 2020 i was postdoctoral scholar with Prof. Christian Linder at the Stanford University (CA/USA) for Scientific Machine Learning material modelling. Since October 2020 i am Co-leader of the Immersive Design Lab and postdoctoral researcher here at ETH Zurich in the field of Scientific Machine Learning {material; structural systems} modelling and extended reality (XR).

Besides that i am running a consultancy office for structural analysis and deployment of Machine and Deep Learning to the AEC industry.
