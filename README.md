### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Professor for Structural Analysis at ISMD of TU Darmstadt, working in the fields of design and analysis of engineering structures with a strong focus on Scientific Machine & Deep Learning. 

I am interested in interdisciplinary research between Civil Engineering and Machine Perception leveraging multi-modal data and engineering theory.

I studied civil engineering at Technical University Munich and completed my PhD at Bundeswehr University Munich in February 2019, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. My research was concerned with machine learning based material modelling of interlayer polymers and glass fracture patterns. From January to September 2020 i was postdoctoral scholar with Prof. Christian Linder at the Stanford University (CA/USA) for Scientific Machine Learning material modelling. Since October 2020 I held the position of a Postdoctoral Researcher and was Co-leader of the Immersive Design Lab at ETH Zurich (CH) in the field of Scientific Machine Learning {material; structural systems} modelling and extended reality (XR).

Besides that i am running a consultancy office for structural analysis and deployment of Machine and Deep Learning to the AEC industry.
