## <a name="Philisophy"></a>Philisophy and Mission Statement
Is it possible for a civil engineer, as a member of a university, to pursue both a successful teaching ca-reer and future-oriented science while serving as a link between research and application? And can a civil engineer make significant research contributions in another field such as architecture or computer science? From my previous experience as a post-doctoral researcher at Stanford and ETH Zurich, I can answer this question with a bright YES. 

I conduct research and teaching at the boundary of architecture, structural engineering and computer sciences with the aim of further establishing digital methods and in particular Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as providing novel computational tools for the sustainable, appealing yet reliable design and analysis of critial structures of the built environment. As an engineer working in academia, my research follows the strictest scientific principles, research results translate into concrete and actionable recommendations for practice, in addition to professional publications. I collaborate with prestigious academic institutions as well as leading engineering offices and AEC companies including Bergmeister Ingenieure, Kuraray, Dywidag and Dlubal Software. So far I have learned, that integrating architecture, structural and environmental engineering still remains a vast challenge for design of buidlings and bridges. To take on this challenge, I use my interdisciplinary background in civil engineering and computational mechanics to conduct research in three main areas: Scientific Machine Learning for engineering, structural design, and construction materials.

In the first phase, non-​linear FE models for reinforced concrete plates and slabs developed at ETH Zurich are combined with AI methods to create hybrid AI-​FEM models. These are much more efficient than established analysis methods both in terms of the computing power required and the reliability of predicting the load-​bearing behaviour. With the completion of the first phase, a validated software demonstrator of AI-​FEM hybrids for the efficient non-​linear analysis and design of reinforced concrete structures is available.
