## <a name="description"></a>Course Description
In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence technology was introduced to the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Numerous application achievments have since been reached in this interdisciplinary field. However, yet today fundamental questions on the application of the relevant AI subgroups of Machine and Deep Learning for Design, Verification and Construction situations have not answered. In order to enable current students as practicioners and researcher of the future with a basic yet solid understanding of the AI technology and what essential points to consider when applying AI to this specific domain.

The availability of data together from different sources together with the interoperability of modern Building Information Modeling (BIM) software within the design and verification workflow for AEC allow applicability of the new AI technology. This augmented building project delivery mode leverages an increase in efficiency and decreases risks due to lack of data-informed decisions in this trillion-dollar industry. However, cautious and well-thought steps need to be taken in the right direction, in order for such technologies to thrive in an industry that showcases inertia in technological adoption.

## <a name="structure"></a>Course Structure
The course will be delivered as a three phase lecture:
1.  he first phase introduces fundamentals of the Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) technology, as building blocks to be considered during the development of related applications. Highlight of this lecture part are the various methods for deploying civil engineering domain knowledge to ML/DL to form Scientific ML (SciML). The approaches are discussed concerning latest developments and implementation obstacles.
2.  The second phase consists of 3 lectures on the combination of AEC domain specific knowledge and state-of-the-art ML.
3.  The third phase consists of 2 classes for guiding and supporting participants in solving and deploying their project.

In the points of connection students will see the importance of taking into account the application requirements when designing an AI system, as well as their impact on the building blocks. Guest speakers from both, the AI and AEC domains, provide complementary impulses for participants of this lectures.

## <a name="objectives"></a>Course Objectives
By the end of the course students will develop computational thinking related to the combination of domain knowledge and latest computer science AI technology for scientific machine learning applications within the AEC domain. Specifically, the students will:

*   Gain fundamental understanding on how **AI / ML / DL technology** works and the impact it may have in the AEC industry.
*   Gain understanding on how to **combine specific knowledge from AEC domain with state-of-the-art ML/DL** to deploy SciML models.
*   **Identify limitations, pitfalls, and bottlenecks** in these applications.
*   Develop **critical thinking** on solutions for the above issues.
*   Acquire **hands-on experience** in creatively thinking and designing an application together with the computational problem solving SciML approach.
*   Use this course as a **"stepping-stone" to Machine Learning-intensive courses** offered in D-BAUG and D-ARCH.

## <a name="evaluation"></a>Course Evaluation
*   **Assignments: 10% of grade**. Students will be given assignments throughout the course that they are required to submit as part of their evaluation. Each assignment will contribute equally to the final grade. The assignments will have two compponents: hands-on experimentation with pre-given modules and critical thinking on the output of the experiments. Due dates are dispersed throughout the semester based on the covered material.
*   **Oral Examination: 30% of grade**. Students will be examined on the covered material at the end of the semester right after their project presentation.
*   **Course Project: 60% of grade**. The course has a final project (in lieu of a final written exam) which will be performed in groups. The project deliverables are an in-class presentation at the final day and a report. Both slides and report are to be submitted as part of the final examination. Preparation for it will start early on in the semester and we will guide you through the milestones: (1st milestone) Submit the title of your project, a short description, and the names of the members in your team. Note that title and description could change as you explore the project; (2nd milestone) Submit mid-term report with progress on the project; (3rd and final milestone) Present your project in class and submit a report.
