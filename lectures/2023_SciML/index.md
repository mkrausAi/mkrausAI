## <a name="description"></a>Course Description
In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence technology was introduced to the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Numerous application achievments have since been reached in this interdisciplinary field. However, yet today fundamental questions on the application of the relevant AI subgroups of Machine and Deep Learning for design, verification and construction situations have not answered. This lecture wants to equip current students as practicioners and researcher of the future with a basic yet solid understanding of the AI technology and what essential points to consider when applying AI to this specific domain.

The availability of data together from different sources together with the interoperability of modern Building Information Modeling (BIM) software within the design and verification workflow for AEC allow applicability of the new AI technology. This augmented building project delivery mode leverages an increase in efficiency and decreases risks due to lack of data-informed decisions in this trillion-dollar industry. However, cautious and well-thought steps need to be taken in the right direction, in order for such technologies to thrive in an industry that showcases inertia in technological adoption. To that end, this lecutre sheds some ligh on trustworthy and explainable AI. The hands-on approach during exercieses but also by conducting projects with real world applications of AI in different fields of AEC guarantees tangible outcomes of this lecture for the participants.

## <a name="structure"></a>Course Structure
The course will be delivered as a three phase lecture:
1.  The first phase introduces fundamentals of the Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) technology, as building blocks to be considered during the development of related applications. Highlight of this lecture part are the various methods for deploying civil engineering domain knowledge to ML/DL to form Scientific ML (SciML). The approaches are discussed concerning latest developments and implementation obstacles.
2.  The second phase consists of guest lectures with specific state-of-the-art industry and research applications of SciML.
3.  The third phase consists of classes for guiding and supporting participants in solving and deploying their project.

In the points of connection, students will see the importance of taking into account the application requirements when designing an AI system, as well as their impact on the building blocks. Guest speakers from both, the AI and AEC domains, provide complementary impulses for participants of this lectures.

## <a name="objectives"></a>Course Objectives
This course will present methods of scientific machine and deep learning (ML / DL) for applications in design and construction in civil engineering. After providing proper background on ML and the scientific ML (SciML) track, several applications of SciML together with their computational implementation during the design and construction process of the built environment are examined.

By the end of the course students will develop computational thinking related to the combination of domain knowledge and latest computer science AI technology for scientific machine learning applications within the AEC domain. Specifically, the students will:

*   Gain fundamental understanding on how **AI / ML / DL technology** works and the impact it may have in the AEC industry.
*   Gain understanding on how to **combine specific knowledge from AEC domain with state-of-the-art ML/DL** to deploy SciML models.
*   **Identify limitations, pitfalls, and bottlenecks** in these applications.
*   Develop **critical thinking** on solutions for the above issues.
*   Acquire **hands-on experience** in creatively thinking and designing an application together with the computational problem solving SciML approach.
*   Use this course as a **"stepping-stone" to Machine Learning-intensive courses** offered in D-BAUG and D-ARCH.

## <a name="evaluation"></a>Course Evaluation
*   **Oral Examination: 50% of grade**. Students will be examined on the covered material at the end of the semester right after their project presentation.
*   **Course Project: 50% of grade**. The course has a final project (in lieu of a final written exam) which will be performed in groups of up to 2 students. The project deliverables are an in-class presentation at the final day and a report in form of a scientific paper. Both, slides and report, are to be submitted as part of the final examination. Preparation for it will start early on in the semester and we will guide you through the milestones: (1st milestone) Submit the title of your project, a short description, and the names of the members in your team. Note that title and description could change as you explore the project; (2nd milestone) show progress of your work during project consultant hours (e.g. PowerPoint slides, intermediate reports); (3rd and final milestone) Present your project in class and submit a final report.
