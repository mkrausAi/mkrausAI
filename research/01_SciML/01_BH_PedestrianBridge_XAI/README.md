## <a name="description"></a>Project Description
In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence technology was introduced to the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Numerous application achievments have since been reached in this interdisciplinary field. However, yet today fundamental questions on the application of the relevant AI subgroups of Machine and Deep Learning for design, verification and construction situations have not answered. This lecture wants to equip current students as practicioners and researcher of the future with a basic yet solid understanding of the AI technology and what essential points to consider when applying AI to this specific domain.

This line of work is concerned with the Generative Design of a Pedestrian Bridge

[They created the time-series data benchmarking set](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/). This data set enables testing of new techniques on an assortment of real world data sets. For commerical buildings data, we are doing the same!


## <a name="objectives"></a>Objectives
This course will present methods.

By the end of the course students will develop computational thinking related to the combination of domain knowledge and latest computer science AI technology for scientific machine learning applications within the AEC domain. Specifically, the students will:
*   Gain fundamental understanding on how **AI / ML / DL technology** works and the impact it may have in the AEC industry.
*   Gain understanding on how to **combine specific knowledge from AEC domain with state-of-the-art ML/DL** to deploy SciML models.
*   **Identify limitations, pitfalls, and bottlenecks** in these applications.
*   Develop **critical thinking** on solutions for the above issues.
*   Acquire **hands-on experience** in creatively thinking and designing an application together with the computational problem solving SciML approach.
*   Use this course as a **"stepping-stone" to Machine Learning-intensive courses** offered in D-BAUG and D-ARCH.

## Introducing the Building Data Genome Project
It is an open data set from 507 non-residential buildings that includes hourly whole building electrical meter data for one year. Each of the buildings has meta data such as  or area, weather, and primary use type. This data set can be used to benchmark various statistical learning algorithms and other data science techniques. It can also be used simply as a teaching or learning tool to practice dealing with measured performance data from large numbers of non-residential buildings. The charts below illustrate the breakdown of the buildings according to location, building industry, sub-industry, and primary use type.

### Please contribute new data sets or provide analysis examples in Jupyter using the data
