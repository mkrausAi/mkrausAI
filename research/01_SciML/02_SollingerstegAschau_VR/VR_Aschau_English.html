<h2 id="-a-name-description-a-motivation-und-zielsetzung"><a name="description"></a>Motivation and Objectives</h2>
<p>The potential of extended reality (XR: includes virtual, augmented and mixed reality) for structural and civil engineering is great, but current applications 
  in practice tend to remain prototypes. The conceptual design phase of a construction project in particular requires the integration of the interests and needs 
  of various people and groups involved, for whom the technical language of the planners and the form of design communication in plan abstractions, static models 
  or principle sketches represent a hurdle to understanding. However, the achievement of a Pareto-optimality due to the mutual understanding in this first phase 
  of a building is essential to guarantee the later acceptance and satisfaction in the width of the affected and involved persons. In public construction projects, 
  the early democratization of decision-making through various forms of citizen information and participation is increasingly in focus. 
  Therefore, in this project, a team from construction, planning and research joined forces to work out the technical and organizational challenges for this and 
  to develop an efficient and appealing solution using Virtual Reality (VR).</p>
<p>The development under this project has the following objectives: </p>
<ul>
<li>Development of an approach for data integration of GIS and BIM models into a VR development environment</li>
<li> erivation of the necessary components for the design of the VR simulation (information, control, level of detail) </li>
<li>Implementation of several design variants in the VR environment </li>
<li>Execution and evaluation of demonstration applications with the development team and the building community</li>
<li>Implementation and evaluation of analog and online public participation</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of this project, we were able to demonstrate the successful technical and organizational applicability of our approach, so that other 
  construction projects can be accompanied in the conceptual design phase in the future. In this way, we are promoting the further dissemination and use of such 
  tools in practice and breaking down barriers to public participation.</p>

<h2 id="-a-name-content-a-projektbeschreibung-sollingersteg-in-aschau-im-chiemgau"><a name="content"></a>Project Description &quot;Sollingersteg&quot; in Aschau im Chiemgau</h2>
<p>Aschau im Chiemgau is a municipality in the Upper Bavarian district of Rosenheim, located in the middle of the picturesque Priental valley. The municipality consists of the two main villages 
  of Aschau and Sachrang and is literally divided by the river Prien. Due to this location, there are numerous bridges in the municipality that play an important 
  role in the infrastructure, especially for pedestrians and cyclists. In addition to being the main traffic routes for the climatic health resort, these bridges 
  require regular maintenance and upkeep.</p>

<p>The last structural inspection of the Sollingersteg, a 21-meter-span pedestrian bridge located in the town center next to the town hall, revealed that the 
  steel structure is severely damaged by severe corrosion. Refurbishment is not economically feasible due to the main support elements in the abutments being 
  embedded in concrete. The Sollingersteg is one of the most important traffic routes for pedestrians and cyclists in the municipality, but with its current clear 
  width of approx. 1.80 m it is no longer up to date for a highly frequented footpath. The steel structure consists of two longitudinal beams made of IPE sections, 
  reinforced by a longitudinal bracing of angle sections at the bottom chord. Finally, the two longitudinal girders are flexurally rigidly tied at the abutment.</p>

<p>After the damage to the old bridge was detected, the municipal council decided to build a replacement bridge and commissioned the engineering office 
  Köppl-Ingenieure Rosenheim to work out possible variants. The choices were a steel beam bridge, a wooden beam bridge, a wooden truss bridge with a roof, 
  a wooden arch bridge and a steel truss bridge with round tube sections. The local council finally decided in favor of a roofed wooden truss bridge, for which, 
  however, as filigree a structure as possible was to be developed in order to blend in well with the surrounding buildings. A virtual reality simulation model is 
  being created for further decision-making, with particular consideration of the effect of the pedestrian bridge alone and in interaction with the embedding 
  environment.</p>

<h2 id="-a-name-vrdemonstrator-a-virtual-reality-demonstrator"><a name="VRDemonstrator"></a>Virtual Reality Demonstrator</h2>
<p>In the course of further planning, two design alternatives with roofing as well as a construction without a roof are now to be compared. 
  For better and more accessible communication of the technical planning with all parties involved and the public, this will be done using a VR demonstrator. 
  The implementation within the scope of this project was done with Unity on an Oculus Quest 2.</p>
<p>The VR model is thereby as an interactive 3D model of the surroundings (section 1 km x 1 km) of the village Aschau im Chiemgau, the local development 
  (in LOD200) as well as the three bridge variants in LOD 300. The digital terrain model, the texture in the form of an orthophoto and the local development 
  (LoD2) are among the free geodata provided by the Bavarian Surveying Administration 
  (<a href="https://geodatenonline.bayern.de/geodatenonline/">https://geodatenonline.bayern.de/geodatenonline/</a>). All geometric elements have real scale in the 
  VR application. Interaction between the app and users takes place via a text field on the tablet on the one hand and via the controller buttons on the other. 
  Users can move freely using the controller keys or a teleportation beam (see Figure 2a). In the VR environment, users can view the three bridge variants 
  (see Figure 2a) from different angles. On the one hand, five predefined viewing locations (yellow markings in Figure 2a) can be used. On the other hand, 
  the two hand controllers allow the rotation of the model or a change of location by means of teleportation or translation. An exemplary section of the VR 
  simulation is shown as a view of the portal of bridge variant 2 in figure 2b.</p>

<p>As we assume that the vast majority of project participants but also citizens are not familiar with VR, an introductory tutorial explaining the most important 
  functions is offered before use. The subsequent exploration phase for the exploration of the environment and the three bridge variants is then person-centered 
  and takes place without further guidance. In the process, the described functionalities can be used.</p>

<h2 id="-a-name-conclusions-a-res-mee"><a name="conclusions"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>In a final municipal council meeting with citizen participation, different variants of the truss bridge were visualized by means of VR on 14.03.2023 and 
  subsequently discussed. A video of a tour in VR with viewing of the different variants from several angles is provided in Figure 3. 
  Finally, the decision was made in favor of a pedestrian bridge variant 4 based on design 3 in steel truss construction as a compromise between sustainability 
  and filigree appearance. The dynamic VR simulation made it possible to realistically assess and decide on the effect and integration of the various bridge 
  variants from diverse perspectives of different persons and decision-makers on different length scales. Thus a high acceptance of the planning and finally built 
  pedestrian bridge is guaranteed. From the very positive feedback of the participants but also participating persons, the potential for re-use and further use in 
  the future can be underpinned.</p>
